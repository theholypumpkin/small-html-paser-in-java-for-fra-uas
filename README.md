# Java Distributed Systems 

This reposetory is an upload of code I would on a few years back before I used git. The code is supposed to be seen as entierly depricated. And likely will not crash somewhere. For this reason the project will therefore be licenced as "_WTFPL_" (What the Fuck You Want to Public License)

This is a small HTML parser, it searches for a sting on a website.
