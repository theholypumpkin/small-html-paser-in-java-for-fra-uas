#Java Distributed Systems This reposetory is an upload of code I would on a few years back before I used git. The code is supposed to be seen as entirly depricated. And likely will not crash somewhere. For this reason the project will therefore be licenced as CLOSED SOURCE, even if the code is open to be viewed by everyone.

This is a small HTML parser, it searches for a sting on a website.

The reposetory is overwelmingly intended to show potential future employees that I'm at least capable of writing Java and documenting and understanding it.
